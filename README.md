An editor that is used to modify the questions in (now dead) [Smarty Pins](https://smartypins.withgoogle.com).
It supports outputing to CSV, and HTML.

We also has included 2 smarty pins dataset: The original version, and the punny version.
The original version is a version that is ripped directly from Smarty Pins, while the punny version is very modified version of the original one.

The editor is mostly complete, but some features were not implemented or incomplete.

# Why New Heights?

Because the master repo is a release repo, while the New Heights was a developement repo.
